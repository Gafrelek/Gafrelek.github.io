          Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ <br />
          <br />
          I'm Gregor, a passionate web developer and IT consultant with a knack
          for crafting innovative digital solutions. With years of experience
          working at companies like Google Sweden and Klarna Bank AB, Iâ€™ve honed
          my skills in everything from productivity engineering to HR systems
          and IT support. Currently, I enjoy combining my technical expertise
          with creativity to build user-friendly websites and tools that make
          life easier for businesses and insectioniidkutso love collaborating on
          projects that push the boundaries of what technology can do. When Iâ€™m
          not coding or solving tech puzzles, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring
          new gadgets, diving into a good book, or tinkering with side projects
          to stay ahead of the curve. Feel free to check out my portfolio, or
          drop me a messageâ€”Iâ€™d love to connect and chat about how we can create
          something amazing together! ðŸ˜Š
